# 🐚 Clam Crypt

**Encrypted Identity-Aware Filepath Control**

Clam Crypt is a lightweight encryption framework designed to bind access to file paths via structured keys. It uses a DAG-based access model and supports cryptographic validation through signed blockchain messages (e.g., Banano transactions). This is not just encryption — it is **relationally-aware access control**.

---

## 🔐 Core Concept

Encode access to files based on:
- **Structured Filepaths** (e.g., JSON/CLAM-formatted)
- **Relationship-aware keys** (e.g., private/public pairing, social trust, contextual scope)
- **Signed DAG-backed validation** (optional Banano support)

> "You don’t just encrypt data — you encrypt the path to meaning."

---

## 📁 Features

- 🔗 DAG-validated file access via transaction signatures
- 🧬 Identity-masked access embedding (flagged or obfuscated)
- 📚 Metadata-aware CLAM file embedding
- 🧠 Structure-first encoding (data is a graph, not a blob)
- ✅ De-identifiable and shareable — data stays secure, traceable, and contextual

---

## 🛠 Use Cases

- Sharing encrypted data **only unlockable by the intended identity**
- Creating **trust-anchored graphs** of documents/files
- Embedding access into **cryptographic memory keys**
- Building systems where **structure = identity = access**

## 🧪 Future Integrations

- ✅ Neo4j / graph-native stores
- 🟡 Ethereum address signing
- 🟡 IPFS-hosted encrypted payloads
- 🟡 Integration with UMatter Systems & ActiveShell

## ✨ Inspiration
This isn’t just about protecting data. It’s about encoding context, relational meaning, and structured access in a world overloaded with raw storage.

> **Clam Crypt** — where data knows who it belongs to.
